Using Ublox U-Center:

1. View> Messages View
	UBX, CFG, CFG
	Press "Send" to save any changes to receiver memory.
	Final step must be done after all changes have been made or after loading config files. 

2. Use file "NtripBaseConfigNoLocation.txt"
	- Tools/Receiver Configuration/File->GNSS
	
3. Location
	- use survey-in
	- or to set fixed location:
	View> Messages View
	UBX, CFG, TMODE3

	Press "Send".
	Save as in step 1.


The remaining settings are already entered in "NtripBaseConfigNoLocation.txt".


4. Rates
	UBX, CFG, Rate
	For each time source in the drop-down box, set measurement period to 1000, set Navigation rate to 1 cyc. This will set the base message rate to 1 per second, which is what you want for the RTCMv3 messages coming from the base station. click “send”

5. to change which messages are sent
	View> Messages View
